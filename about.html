            <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
              As a highly experienced leader of multidisciplinary teams, I lead
              projects in development, data, infrastructure, and compliance,
              ensuring efficient and effective project delivery. I possess the
              ability to establish OKRs, monitor applications, conduct code
              reviews, and handle software architecture, while also directly
              managing data integrity and lifecycle, preserving privacy and
              security, and supporting project managers and PO's, developers,
              infrastructure and support teams, and documenting software and
              established processes.
            </p>
            <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
              I have also played a key role in implementing and maintaining
              ISO27001 & ISO27701 standards, ensuring the security and
              compliance of company-wide data. I conduct cost analysis for cloud
              services (Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean) and annual budgeting, always
              striving for the best combination of cost efficiency and
              performance. I hold meetings with executive management, implement
              processes such as GTD, Agile methodology, and management tools,
              offering innovative and customized solutions for each project.
            </p>
            <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
              In my management style, I strive to maintain a more human
              approach, focusing on developing all teams under my leadership,
              always considering the happiness and well-being of my colleagues.
              My goal is always to achieve high performance results while
              maintaining a healthy and collaborative work environment.
