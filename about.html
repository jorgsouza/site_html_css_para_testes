        <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
          As a highly experienced leader of multidisciplinary teams, I lead
          projects in development, data, infrastructure, and compliance,
          ensuring efficient and effective project delivery. I possess the
          ability to establish OKRs, monitor applications, conduct code reviews,
          and handle software architecture, while also directly managing data
          integrity and lifecycle, preserving privacy and security, and
          supporting project managers and PO's, developers, infrastructure and
          support teams, and documenting software and established processes.
        </p>
        <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
          I have also played a key role in implementing and maintaining ISO27001
          & ISO27701 standards, ensuring the security and compliance of
          company-wide data. I conduct cost analysis for cloud services (Azure,
          AWS, Digital Ocean) and annual budgeting, always striving for the best
          combination of cost efficiency and performance. I hold meetings with
          executive management, implement processes such as GTD, Agile
          methodology, and management tools, offering innovative and customized
          solutions for each project.
        </p>
        <p class="presentation__content__paragraph">
          In my management style, I strive to maintain a more human approach,
          focusing on developing all teams under my leadership, always
          considering the happiness and well-being of my colleagues. My goal is
          always to achieve high performance results while maintaining a healthy
          and collaborative work environment.
